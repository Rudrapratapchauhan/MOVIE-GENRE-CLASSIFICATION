# MOVIE-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION

Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to classify movies into their respective genres based on features such as movie descriptions, metadata, and other relevant information. Accurate genre classification can enhance user experience in recommendation systems and improve content organization.

Data Collection
The project involves gathering a dataset that includes:

Movie Titles: The names of the movies.
Movie Descriptions: Synopses or plot summaries of the movies.
Metadata: Information such as release year, director, cast, and crew.
Genres: Labels indicating the genres of the movies (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama).
Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial to prepare the data for model training. This includes:

Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, stop words, and performing other text normalization tasks on movie descriptions.
Feature Extraction: Converting textual data into numerical features using techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings.
Handling Missing Values: Addressing any missing values in the dataset.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Converting categorical metadata into numerical values using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
Model Building
The core of the project involves designing and training a machine learning model. The process includes:

Model Selection: Choosing appropriate models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or more complex models like Neural Networks.
Model Training: Training the model on the training dataset using extracted features.
